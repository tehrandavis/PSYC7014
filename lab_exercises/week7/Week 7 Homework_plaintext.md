# Week 6 Homework

This weeks homework involves the file **anxiety_data.csv**

## Part 1

Dr. Flora is studying the relationship between anxiety and baseline heart rate. He hypothesizes that there is a positive relationship between the two, such that people that are more anxious will have a higher basline heart rate. To test this he administers the Davis anxiety test (score range 0-60). Any score equal to 40 or above he deems as a person with high anxiety and score lower than 40 is low anxiety. He wants to test whether participants in the high anxiety group have on average a higher resting heart rate than participant from the low anxiety group.

- what is the appropriate test for Dr. Flora's hypothesis?
- conduct the appropriate analysis including
  - Appropriate checks for assumptions related to the data (e.g., normality? homogeneity?)
  - The appropriate visualization of this data given the hypothesis (what is a good type of plot to make? Make it!!)
  - Run the appropriate inferential test.
- write up you results being sure to include all relevant information for a proper report (test statistic, means if applicable, **effect size**, figure caption, etc).



## Part 2

Dr. Turing is also studying the relationship between anxiety and baseline heart rate. She happens to come across Dr. Flora's data set that he has graciously shared on his [OSF](www.osf.io) page. She notices that in his document he reports data related to group differences, but his data set also includes raw anxiety scores. She elects to follow-up on his data set, testing the relationship between individual's baseline heart rate and these raw anxiety scores. She hypothesizes that there is a positive relationship between the two, such that people that are more anxious will have a higher basline heart rate. 

- what is the appropriate test for Dr. Turing's hypothesis?
- conduct the appropriate analysis including
  - Appropriate checks for assumptions related to the data (e.g., normality? homogeneity?)

## Part 3

Given what you know, what investigator do you believe conducted the more apprioate test? Why? I know these were listed as optional a few weeks back, but it might be worth it to check out:

- MacCallum et al (2002) â€œOn the practice of dichotomization of quantitative variables."

- Altman (2006) "The cost of dichotomising continuous variables"
